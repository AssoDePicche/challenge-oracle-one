# Challenge Oracle One

`Programming Logic`

The challenge consists in developing an application that encrypts and decrypts texts by changing the vowels present in them following some rules:

- The letter "a" should be converted to "ai"

- The letter "e" should be converted to "enter"

- The letter "i" should be converted to "imes

- The letter "o" should be converted to "ober

- The letter "u" should be converted to "ufat"

`E.g:` The word "cat" should be converted to "gaitober" and "gaitober" should be converted to "cat".

## Requirements

- Must work with lowercase letters only

- No letters with accents or special characters should be used

- It must be possible to convert a word to the encrypted version and also return an encrypted word to the original version.

- The page must have a text field where the user can type the text to be encrypted or decrypted (the user can choose between these two options)

- The result should be displayed on the screen

## Extra Features

- A button to copy the encrypted/decrypted text to the clipboard
